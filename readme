# sup
sup - user privilege escalation.
# Description
The sup program is supposed to be way more secure, fast and simple
replacement of sudo. It's reached by in-compiled rules and the run
politics since it can run only not writable files. Also the
standard installation makes it unreadable, so only really
reliable users can run the exact programs you specified.
## Installation
	$ vi config.h # Edit to set rules.
	$ vi mkconfig # Set up installation for your system.
	# mk install # Run with root privileges.
